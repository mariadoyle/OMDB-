# OMDB-
A web page that allows a user to search for movies in the OMDB by name.

For this project, I used HTML5, CSS3, jQuery and Javascript. Please note that this is a small project and I chose to put the html, the css and the javascript files into one.If the project were any bigger, I would have created one html file, one css file and one javascript file for modularity purposes. 

To test this project, the user needs to follows steps below:
1) Type movie title and press or click on the enter button and
2) Click on movie button recently created after typing movie title and click on it
Once you click on the movie button, you will see the movie's rating, release date, a plot description and poster. If the user types a movie title that does not exist on the OMDB, the following information will be displayed:
Rating: undefined 
Released: undefined 
Plot: undefined
